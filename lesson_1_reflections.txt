How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It will help me to know where and how mistakes o typos I made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It should help me find and clear typos or mistakes I made in a new version and giving me an opportunity to backup it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I think it is better choise to commit manually for the reasons of logical completness of each version of code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It is done for more effective saving your project and opportunity to download last version project at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Logs helps to find all commits done and diff helps to compare each commit with another one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can return to previous versions by git checkout commitID and check your bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try upload my project.
